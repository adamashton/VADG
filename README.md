VADG
====

VADG stands for Visualising And Desigining Grammars. This program will take programming language grammars as inputs and visualise them so they are easier to comprehend. This was my 3rd year project during University and my first attempt at writing a C# system from scratch using the Model View Controller pattern.

ABSTRACT
========
Two problems are identified with the use of grammars. A new idea and
unfamiliar concepts can present many problems to the inexperienced
student. Secondly, their use in computer science to describe programming
languages leads to large and complex grammars. There are also a
lack of tools available to support their understanding and development.
A novel way of visualising grammars is introduced, accompanied by an
implementation in a program. The visualisation uses boxes to represent
rules and they are nested to utilise a grammars hierarchical property.
The program provides an enviornment to browse grammars written in
the popular Backus-Naur Form (BNF). Expanding/collapsing boxes allow
rules to be examined with ease. In addition, the visualisations can
be used to develop grammars.
The representation is clear and easy to understand, adding a level of
abstraction away from the variations in BNF notation. The design enviornment
is intuitive to use allowing users to comfortably write or extend
their grammars.

USAGE
=====
Clone this repository and open the solution in Visual Studio / Visual Express.

The program should just run and load a GUI interface.

Load a test grammar or copy/paste a grammar into the text box.

REPORT
======
This repository also comes with my 3rd year report. Read this for A LOT more information about the program and visualising grammars in general.
